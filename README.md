- **Trust**: Team members who feel trusted are empowered and motivated to their best work, which in turn helps the business.
- **Work-life balance:** I highly value personal time, therefore I avoid participating in on-call rotations. This commitment enables me to bring my best self to the workplace and ensures sustained productivity.

## What I value in others

- **Honesty:** I greatly value honesty and transparent communication. It's crucial for building strong professional relationships.
- **Growth mindset:** Embracing challenges as opportunities for development is key. I appreciate colleagues who share a growth mindset and recognize the potential for improvement in every situation.
- **Innovation and creativity**: I appreciate colleagues who bring innovative ideas and creative solutions to the table.
- **Resilience:** In the face of challenges, resilience is key. I value colleagues who approach setbacks with a positive attitude and a determination to overcome obstacles.
- **Openness to feedback:** A willingness to give and receive constructive feedback is crucial for personal and professional growth. I highly value colleagues who embrace feedback as an opportunity for improvement.

## My strengths

- **Attention to detail:** I take pride in meticulously examining every aspect of a project, ensuring a high level of quality in the work delivered.
- **Reliability:** My team can rely on me to consistently deliver on my promises and commitments.
- **Fearlessness:** In the face of challenges, I approach problem-solving with courage and a positive mindset.
- **Data-driven decision-making**: I leverage data and analytics to make informed decisions.

## My weaknesses

- **Real-time responses:** If you need a quick response to a nontrivial question or feedback, I may take a bit more time to provide a well-thought-out and high-quality response. I've learned that my responses are of lower quality when Iâ€™m under time pressure.
- **Lack of strong opinions**: I donâ€™t often express strong opinions. Usually, I prefer to adapt and collaborate based on collective input. While this adaptability allows for smooth teamwork, there might be moments where a more assertive stance could be beneficial.
- **Prone to overcommitting:** My enthusiasm for taking on challenges can sometimes lead to overcommitting. I am working on enhancing my ability to prioritize effectively and set realistic expectations.
- **Perfectionism:** I strive for excellence in my work and am continually seeking improvement. As a result, I'm rarely fully happy with the solution I delivered.

## How I work

### Communication

- I am easygoing; feel free to be as direct as possible with me.
- I prefer asynchronous communication but am available for synchronous communication when necessary.
- I strongly believe most communication should be public. Thereâ€™s only a handful of reasons when direct messages or private channels are justifiable. Public channels are transparent, inclusive, discoverable, and overall better. ðŸ™‚

### Meetings

- My calendar is always up to date.
- I prefer meetings with an objective and agenda.
- I prefer thoughtful asynchronous discussions over meaningless meetings.

### Work environment

- I work from home.
- I use Linux (Fedora).
- My primary IDE is RubyMine, but I occasionally use VS Code for personal projects.
