Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juraj (pronounced like yur-eye), a senior software engineer. Welcome to my personal readme - a little guide to who I am, how I work, and what I care about. Whether you're a teammate, friend, or just curious, I hope this gives you a better sense of what makes me tick.

## About me

- I've worked in industries such as biometric identification, video-on-demand, and crowdtesting, taking on roles as a full-stack developer, backend developer, and even a data engineer.
- Outside of work, I'm passionate about cycling, board games, and experimenting in the kitchen with cooking and baking.

## My values

These are the principles I try to live by and appreciate in others:
- **Transparency**: I believe the organization I work with should be upfront and open about its actions. This not only fosters trust but also serves as motivation for the team. Transparency ensures that everyone is on the same page, understanding the reasoning behind decisions and actions.
- **Trust**: Team members who feel trusted are empowered and motivated to do their best work, which in turn benefits the business.
- **Work-life balance**: I value my personal time, so I avoid on-call rotations. A healthy balance keeps me energized and allows me to bring my best self to work.
- **Honesty**: Being genuine and straightforward strengthens relationships and builds mutual respect.
- **Empathy**: Understanding different perspectives and treating people with care makes for better teamwork.
- **Growth mindset**: Challenges are opportunities to learn and grow. I love working with people who see things the same way.
- **Openness to feedback**: I value constructive feedback and see it as an opportunity for growth - for myself and the team.

## My strengths

- **Attention to detail**: I care about the little things that make a big difference in quality.
- **Reliability**: If I say I'll do something, you can count on me to follow through.
- **Resilience**: I approach problems with determination, optimism, and a solution-oriented mindset.
- **Data-driven decision-making**: I leverage data and analytics to guide my decisions and solve problems effectively.

## My weaknesses

- **Real-time responses:** If you need a quick answer to a complex question, I may take extra time to ensure my response is thoughtful and high-quality. I've learned that my responses can sometimes suffer in quality when I'm under time pressure.
- **Over-explaining**: I like to provide plenty of context when I communicate. I'm learning to say more with fewer words.
- **Perfectionism:** I strive for excellence in my work, which sometimes makes me overly critical of the work I deliver.

If you feel like something important is missing from this list, please let me know.

## How I work

### Communication

- I am easygoing; feel free to be as direct as possible with me.
- I prefer asynchronous communication but I'm happy to jump on a call when needed.
- I prefer to keep communication public whenever possible - it's inclusive, transparent, and helps everyone stay in the loop.

### Feedback

- I see constructive feedback as an opportunity for growth. Be direct and honest with me. I'll always appreciate it, even when it's tough to hear.

### Meetings

- My calendar is always up to date.
- I appreciate meetings with clear goals and agendas.
- I prefer thoughtful asynchronous discussions over meaningless meetings.

### Working hours

- I'm typically online from 9 AM to 6 PM CET.

### Work environment

- I work fully remotely from home.
- I use Linux (Fedora).
- My primary IDE is RubyMine, but I occasionally use VS Code for personal projects.
